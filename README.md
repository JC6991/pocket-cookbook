- The purpose of our application is to allow the user to access a treasure chest of food recipes straight from their pocket. The user is given some inspiration from our favourite recipes, or the option of inputing their own choice of dish.
 Our users are varied, they are users that are on the go, to users that are parents and need last minute inspiration, or just users looking to impress and entertain.

Code
 
- We decided to use Javascript and Jquery to call API's that would give the user access to a vast array of food recipes. We structured or app with HTML and styled it with CSS.

 API

 - We used two API's, one from Spoonacular to call for the recipes and the other was from giphy to add a humorous touch.
